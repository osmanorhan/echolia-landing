        <h2>The Problem with Thinking Tools</h2>
        <p>
          Most note-taking apps want you to be organized. They give you hierarchies, folders, tags, databases. They assume your thinking is linear, complete, ready to file away.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that's not how thinking actually works (for some of us at least).
        </p>
        <p>
          Real thinking is messy. It loops back on itself. It contradicts. It arrives half-formed at 3am and dissolves before you can capture it. It's not <em>done</em>, it's always in-process, always echoing.
        </p>

        <h2>Tumbolia</h2>
        <p>
          Douglas Hofstadter wrote about a place called Tumbolia in <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach</em>:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "The land where dead hiccups and extinguished light bulbs go. Where dormant thoughts wait, in suspension, until they're needed again."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          That's what Echolia is. Not a productivity tool. Not a second brain. A <strong>Tumbolia</strong> for your thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          A place where incomplete thoughts can exist without pressure to be useful, organized, or finished.
        </p>

        <h2>Local-First, Always</h2>
        <p>
          Your thoughts are yours. They stay on your device. We don't have access to them. We can't mine them. We can't sell them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When sync arrives (soon), it will be <strong>end-to-end encrypted</strong>. Even then, we can't read your data. This isn't a nice-to-have, it's the foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can export everything at any time. JSON, Markdown, plain text. You're never locked in.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Designed for Recursion</h2>
        <p>
          Echolia is built for <strong>thoughts that loop</strong>. Ideas that keep coming back, each time slightly different.
        </p>
        <p>
          That design problem you can't solve? Capture it. Come back next week. Add an echo. Three months later, it clicks but only because you can see the whole recursive path.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the kind of thinking that gets lost in traditional tools. Because they expect progress. Forward motion. Echolia expects <em>drift</em>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Aesthetic Matters</h2>
        <p>
          The interface isn't just "dark mode." It's a <strong>warm, analog sci-fi aesthetic</strong> like a retro terminal where thoughts glow softly in the dark.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tumbolia visualization isn't decoration. It's a <em>meditative space</em> that shows your thoughts as living cells, awakening and fading, forming patterns you didn't consciously create.
        </p>
        <p>
          The typography, the grain overlay, the subtle pink-rose glow these aren't arbitrary. They create an <strong>atmosphere for thinking</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not cold productivity. Not sterile efficiency. <em>Warmth.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>What Echolia Is Not</h2>
        <p>
          Echolia is <strong>not</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A todo list</li>
          <li>A journal</li>
          <li>A wiki (for knowledge bases, use Obsidian)</li>
          <li>A productivity tool (we're actively against productivity culture)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Echolia is for the thoughts that <em>don't fit</em> in those tools. The messy, recursive, half-formed fragments that are too small to journal about but too important to forget.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Echolia is built by a solo developer. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m not a productivity guru or a growth team. I’m an engineer who’s a little obsessed with development; less as a profession and more as a lifelong obsession and craft.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m building Echolia slowly, without seeking VC funding or growth targets. Echolia will always be free. No ads. No data mining. No dark patterns.
        </p>
