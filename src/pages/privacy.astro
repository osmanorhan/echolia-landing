          1. Scope
        </h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          This policy applies to the Echolia applications (the “App”) and to the Echolia website at echolia.com (the “Website”).
        </p>

          2. App data
        </h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          Echolia is designed as a local-first application. Content you create in the App is stored on your device in a local database.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          We do not receive or store your notes or other in-app content on our servers unless you explicitly use a sync or online feature that requires data transfer.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          You are responsible for backing up and securing your own data on your devices.
        </p>

          3. Online services and sync
        </h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          If we provide optional online services such as sync or backups, those services will involve transmitting and storing data on our infrastructure or with third-party providers acting on our behalf.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          We will take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect that data and will describe the specific processing in an updated version of this policy when those services are introduced.

        </h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          When you visit the Website, we may collect limited, aggregated usage information such as page views, referrers, and basic device information in order to understand overall traffic and improve the site.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          We use privacy-focused analytics tools, such as Plausible Analytics, that do not use cookies or create profiles based on your browsing across different sites.

          We do not sell or rent any analytics data to third parties.

        </h2>

          We use third-party providers to host the Website, deliver email, and provide analytics. These providers process data on our behalf and in accordance with their own privacy policies.
