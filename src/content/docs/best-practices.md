# Best Practices

Echolia is designed for the way thoughts actually work — messy, recursive, half-formed. These practices help you work *with* that nature, not against it.

---

## Capture Everything

### Lower Your Filter

The most common mistake: only capturing "good" thoughts.

**Instead:**
- Capture fragments
- Capture questions without answers
- Capture feelings without words
- Capture contradictions

Your subconscious makes connections you can't see yet. Trust the process.

### Quick Capture is Your Friend

Use `Cmd+Shift+E` liberally:
- During meetings
- While reading
- In the shower (keep device nearby)
- Right before sleep
- Right after waking

The act of capturing **is** the thinking.

---

## Tag Loosely

### Avoid Hierarchies

Don't create tag systems like:
- `#work/projects/clientA/ideas`

**Instead:**
- `#clientA #ideas`

Echolia finds connections. Hierarchies hide them.

### Use Verbs and States

Good tags describe:
- **Actions:** `#exploring`, `#stuck`, `#solved`
- **States:** `#unclear`, `#resonant`, `#discarded`
- **Moods:** `#anxious`, `#excited`, `#curious`

Not just topics:
- ❌ `#ai`
- ✅ `#ai #questioning`, `#ai #breakthrough`

### Let Tags Emerge

Don't plan your tag system. Let it grow:
1. Week 1: No tags
2. Week 2: Notice what you search for
3. Week 3: Tag retroactively
4. Week 4+: Tags suggest themselves

---

## Revisit Regularly

### The Weekly Drift

Once a week, spend 15 minutes:

1. Open Echolia
2. Don't search for anything specific
3. Scroll slowly through recent thoughts
4. Add echoes when something clicks
5. Delete nothing

This is where connections form.

### Search for Feelings

Don't just search for topics. Search for:
- "I don't know"
- "maybe"
- "???"
- "interesting"

These reveal your live edges — where you're actually thinking.

---

## Write Incomplete Sentences

Echolia is not:
- A journal (complete narratives)
- A notebook (organized notes)
- A todo list (tasks to complete)

It's a **mind-room** for unfinished thinking.

### Examples

**Journal style** (too complete):
> "Today I had an interesting conversation about how AI interfaces should feel more like ambient environments than tools. I think this relates to my earlier ideas about..."

**Echolia style** (raw thought):
> AI as environment not tool — what does that even mean? ambient? #interfaces #unclear

**Journal style:**
> "I'm working on a feature that needs to handle async state. I should research React Query patterns and..."

**Echolia style:**
> async state hell again. react query? or just embrace the chaos #stuck #patterns

---

## Don't Delete

### The Archive Instinct

You'll want to delete:
- "Dumb" ideas
- Solved problems
- Outdated thinking

**Resist.**

Three months from now:
- That "dumb" idea is actually prescient
- That solved problem resurfaces
- That outdated thinking shows your evolution

### Instead of Deleting

Mark things:
- `#resolved`
- `#wrong`
- `#old-thinking`

You can filter them out, but they stay in your Tumbolia.

---

## Use Echolia for Loops

The best use case: **recursive thoughts** that keep coming back.

### Example Flow

**Monday:**
> why does this design feel off? can't place it #design #stuck

**Wednesday:**
> still stuck on design. maybe it's not the colors, it's the spacing? #design #exploring

**Friday:**
> oh — it's not spacing OR colors. it's that I'm designing for what I THINK users want, not what they actually do #design #breakthrough

**Next Monday:**
> wait, that breakthrough was half-right. users DO want that thing. but... #design #looping

This is the kind of thinking Echolia is built for.

---

## Sync Your Workflow

### Morning Dump

Start each day:
1. Open Echolia
2. Capture everything in your head from last night
3. Don't read old thoughts
4. Just empty the buffer

### Evening Drift

End each day:
1. Open Echolia
2. Scroll through today's thoughts
3. Add one echo to one thought
4. That's it

---

## Integration Patterns

### With Other Tools

**For:** Long-form writing (Notion, Obsidian)
**Use Echolia:** Capture fragments, move complete ideas to long-form

**For:** Task management (Todoist, Things)
**Use Echolia:** Capture why a task matters, not the task itself

**For:** Code comments
**Use Echolia:** Design questions, not implementation notes

**For:** Research
**Use Echolia:** Questions and confusions, not citations

---

## When Echolia Clicks

You'll know Echolia is working when:

1. **You search less** — thoughts surface naturally
2. **You write less** — fragments are enough
3. **You connect more** — old thoughts suddenly make sense
4. **You trust more** — you stop trying to organize

Echolia is not a productivity tool. It's a **thinking environment**.

Let it be messy. Let it be incomplete. Let it echo.
