## Capture Everything

### Lower Your Filter

The most common mistake: only capturing "good" thoughts.

**Instead:**
- Capture fragments
- Capture questions without answers
- Capture feelings without words
- Capture contradictions
- Capture something you forget later
- Capture what overflows your mind

Your subconscious makes connections you can't see yet. Trust the process.

### Quick Capture is Your Friend

Use `Cmd+Shift+E` liberally:
- During meetings
- While reading
- Right before sleep
- Right after waking

The act of capturing **is** the thinking.

## Write Incomplete Sentences

Echolia is not:
- A journal (complete narratives)
- A notebook (organized notes)
- A todo list (tasks to complete)

It's a **mind-room** for unfinished thinking.

### Examples

**Journal style**:
> "Today I had an interesting conversation about how AI interfaces should feel more like ambient environments than tools. I think this relates to my earlier ideas about..."

**Echolia style** (raw thought):
> AI as environment not tool.

## Don't Delete (if you dont test)

### The Archive Instinct

You'll want to delete:
- "Dumb" ideas
- Solved problems
- Outdated thinking

**Resist.**

Three months from now:
- That "dumb" idea is actually prescient
- That solved problem resurfaces
- That outdated thinking shows your evolution

## Use Echolia for Loops

The best use case: **recursive thoughts** that keep coming back.

### Example Flow

**Monday:**
> this design feel off can't place it 

**Wednesday:**
> still stuck on design. maybe it's not the colors.

**Friday:**
> oh, it's not spacing OR colors. it's that I'm designing for what I THINK users want, not what they actually do 

**Next Monday:**
> wait, that breakthrough was half-right. users DO want that thing. but...

This is the kind of thinking Echolia is built for.

## Integration Patterns

### With Other Tools

**For:** Long-form writing (Notion, Obsidian)
**Use Echolia:** Capture fragments, move complete ideas to long-form

**For:** Task management (Todoist, Things)
**Use Echolia:** Capture why a task matters, not the task itself

**For:** Code comments
**Use Echolia:** Design questions, not implementation notes

**For:** Research
**Use Echolia:** Questions and confusions, not citations

## When Echolia Clicks

You'll know Echolia is working when:

1. **You search less** — thoughts surface naturally
2. **You write less** — fragments are enough
3. **You connect more** — old thoughts suddenly make sense
4. **You trust more** — you stop trying to organize

Echolia is not a productivity tool. It's a **thinking environment**.

Let it be messy. Let it be incomplete. Let it echo.
