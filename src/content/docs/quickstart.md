## 1) Install and open Echolia

1. Download the installer from the pinned downloads on the homepage (Windows, macOS, Linux).
2. Install and open the app. If you see a security prompt, choose "Open anyway" (macOS: right-click Open; Windows: "More info" -> "Run anyway").
3. Keep Echolia running so Quick Capture stays available.

<ul class="doc-checklist">
  <li>App opens to the Stream without account creation</li>
  <li>Quick Capture shortcut opens from the desktop</li>
  <li>Any OS security prompts are cleared</li>
</ul>

## 2) Capture your first thought

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+E` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+E` (Windows/Linux) to open Quick Capture.
2. App tries to register the shortcut on first run; if it fails, follow the os spesific settings to register it manually.
3. Type a fragment, thoght, idea or reminder or question. Like "Read more about cognitive biases" or "do not forget to call mom". 
4. Press `Enter` to save. Your thought appears at the top of the Stream. The app will handle rest of them. 
5. Click the card to open it. You will see details view. 
6. Keep going and repeat. 

## 3) Learn the views

**Stream**  
Vertical list of everything you've captured. Most recent at the top.
Keep adding thoughts here. Doesnt need to be perfect, doesnt need to be complete.
When it accumulates, the app will start connecting the dots, and some echoes will start to appear.
We also show some dots to show if embedding or other features are extracted.
