Start with one capture. This guide gets you from download to your first saved thought in under 5 minutes.

## 1) Install and open Echolia

1. Download the installer from the pinned downloads on the homepage (Windows, macOS, Linux, or mobile).
2. Install and open the app. If you see a security prompt, choose "Open anyway" (macOS: right-click Open; Windows: "More info" → "Run anyway").
3. Keep Echolia running so Quick Capture stays available.

<ul class="doc-checklist">
  <li>App opens to the Stream without account creation</li>
  <li>Quick Capture shortcut opens from the desktop</li>
  <li>Any OS security prompts are cleared</li>
</ul>

## 2) Capture your first thought

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+E` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+E` (Windows/Linux) to open Quick Capture.
2. Type a fragment or question. Add lightweight tags inline, e.g. `thinking about mind-gardens #design #looping`.
3. Press `Enter` to save. Your thought appears at the top of the Stream.
4. Click the card to open it. Add an echo if you want to expand the idea.

<ul class="doc-checklist">
  <li>Saved one thought with at least one tag</li>
  <li>Reopened it and added a short echo</li>
  <li>Confirmed it shows in the Stream list</li>
</ul>

## 3) Learn the views

**Stream** (default)  
Vertical list of everything you've captured. Most recent at the top.

**Tumbolia**  
A calmer, animated space for idle browsing. Use it when you want to drift and spot patterns.

**Search** (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`)  
Type to find fragments, tags, or dates. Use filters to narrow by tag when the list grows.

Switch views with `Cmd/Ctrl + /` or via the view toggle in the header.

## 4) Keep the loop warm

| Shortcut | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + E` | Quick capture from anywhere |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + N` | New thought in the main app |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + K` | Search / command palette |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + /` | Toggle Stream ↔ Tumbolia |
| `Escape` | Close dialogs or return to Stream |
