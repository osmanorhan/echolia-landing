# Quick Start

Welcome to Echolia. This guide will help you capture your first thought in under 5 minutes.

## First Launch

When you first open Echolia, you'll see the **Tumbolia** — a warm, meditative space where dormant thoughts wait.

The interface is intentionally minimal:
- No accounts required
- No configuration needed
- Just you and your thoughts

---

## Capturing Your First Thought

### The Quick Capture

1. **Press** `Cmd+Shift+E` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+E` (Windows/Linux)
2. **Type** whatever comes to mind
3. **Press** `Enter` to save

That's it. Your thought is now in Tumbolia.

### Understanding the Interface

Echolia has three main views:

**Stream View** (default)
- Vertical list of your thoughts
- Most recent at top
- Scroll to drift through older echoes

**Tumbolia View**
- Cellular automata visualization
- Thoughts become living cells
- Meditative, generative

**Search View** (`Cmd+K`)
- Full-text search
- Filter by tags
- Find connections

## Core Concepts

### Thoughts

A thought is any fragment you capture:
- A fleeting idea
- An unfinished sentence
- A question that won't let go
- A dream you half-remember

Thoughts don't need to be complete. They're meant to be **in-process**.

### Tags

Tag thoughts to create loose connections:

```
thinking about klein bottles #topology #loops
```

Tags appear as `#topology` and `#loops`. Click any tag to see related thoughts.

### Echoes

When you revisit a thought and add to it, you create an **echo**:

1. Click any thought to open it
2. Add your new thinking
3. The timestamp shows when the echo occurred

Each thought becomes a thread of your evolving thinking.

## Your First Week

**Day 1-2:** Just capture
Don't organize, don't categorize. Just dump thoughts.

**Day 3-4:** Add a few tags
Notice natural groupings. Add 1-2 tags per thought.

**Day 5-7:** Revisit
Use search (`Cmd+K`) to find old thoughts. Add echoes when something connects.

---

## What Not to Do

Echolia works best when you:
- **Don't** try to organize everything
- **Don't** write perfect sentences
- **Don't** delete "bad" thoughts
- **Don't** force connections

Let the thoughts drift. The structure emerges over time.
