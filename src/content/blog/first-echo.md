I’m an engineer who lives in text files. I build tools when I’m annoyed, and I was tired of “productivity” apps treating every thought like a task to optimize. Echolia started as a private build on my machine, a place to drop fragments without being graded by streaks or dashboards.


It’s a quiet, local mind-room. No unread counters, no dopamine lights. Just a dark console with soft grain and enough neon to feel alive, not corporate. I wanted an app that let half-finished ideas sit without shame and echo back later when I’m ready.

I don't say this came out of nowhere. I’ve been quietly influenced by teams like 37signals and apps like Obsidian. I like software that feels small, stubborn in a good way, and willing to say “no” to features. AI but not AI.

Before Echolia, we tried to scratch the same itch with a tiny iOS app called [Hiccup AI](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/hiccup-ai/id6474674651). It worked, but I got stuck in a few places: scaling the idea beyond myself, making the UX feel honest, and keeping the infrastructure simple enough that I’d still want to maintain it a year later.

The difference now is the tooling. With coding assistants, I can bounce between Rust, Python, TypeScript; five services at once if I need to and without losing the thread. That doesn’t make the work perfect (yet), it just lowers the friction so I can ship more experiments like this and see what actually helps real brains.

I care more about privacy and control than about charts. That’s why Echolia runs locally first, speaks to models on my box, and doesn’t assume I want to sync everything to remote server. It’s opinionated, maybe rough, and definitely not “growth hacked.”

This build has errors and missing pieces. That’s fine. I’m shipping it anyway because the point is to make thinking easier, not perfect. I hope it will grow into something closer to “right” over time. If you’re drawn to a calmer pace, fewer metrics, welcome to the mind-room!

More echoes soon.
